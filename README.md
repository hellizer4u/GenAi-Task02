# 🎨 Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

Leverage the power of pre-trained generative models like **DALL·E-mini** and **Stable Diffusion** to convert text prompts into stunning and creative images. This project explores how natural language can be used to control image generation using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
